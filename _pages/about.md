About Me (Seriously Talking)
======
* Hate raining days.
* Inexplicably love telling jokes in broken english.
* Spawned the rule of ejection in southern baseball league by throwing 3 HBP in an single inning.
* League of Legends Challenger.
* Fine, I'm actually a Diamond 1.
* Alright, alright. I'm a Bronze 2. Shut up.
* Not sure why I'm writing this site at all since no one will visit here except probably my mom.
