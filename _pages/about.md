I am Ting-Wei, Lu (盧庭偉) from Taiwan, currently a MS student at Cornell Tech in New York City studying Information Systems and Applied Information Science. Before that, I was a research assistant for the [Chinese Knowledge and Information Processing Laboratory (CKIP)](https://ckip.iis.sinica.edu.tw/) at Academia Sinica, advised by [Dr. Wei-Yun Ma](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/ma/), working on various NLP topics with a focus on Data-to-Text Generation. I recieved my bachelor's degree from the department of Engineering Science at National Taiwan University. Previously, I joined the [Machine Intelligence Understanding Lab](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~miulab/), advised by [Prof.Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/index.html), on various research topics.

<strong>I am actively seeking intern positions for software engineering or machine learning engineeering in summer 2022!</strong>. If you're interested in my work, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:tim8733123@gmail.com).
